Located at the top center of the applet there are two boxes. The one on the left is the "x coordinate" and the one on the right is the "y coordinate". The game applet is set up as follows:<br>
(0,0) (500,0)<Br>
(0,500) (500 ,500)<br>
<br>
<Br><br>
Meaning that the top left corner is x coordinate 0 and y coordinate 0<br>
The top right corner is x coordinate 500 and y coordinate 0 and so on and so fourth. The object is to destroy all of the enemies soilders. Beware, the more levels you advance the less bombs you recieve. So make sure to think over your coordinates ;) Happy hunting!
